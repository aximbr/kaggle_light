Experiments with IA using containers

For your enviroment variables (including KAGGLE_KEY and KAGGLE_USERNAME), save them on file 
devcontainer.env inside root folder.

If require more libs, just add them on requirements.txt on root folder.

If you want run multipler containers, adjust the host port to avoid conflict between containers running Jupiter server on same port tcp/8888 (docker-composer_xx.yml)
